        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
          In this talk, we will consider minimal triple junction surfaces, a special class of singular minimal surfaces whose boundaries are identified in a particular manner. Hence, it is quite natural to extend the classical theory of minimal surfaces to minimal triple junction surfaces. Indeed, we can show that the classical PDE theory holds on triple junction surfaces. As a consequence, we can prove a type of Generalized Bernstein Theorem and talk about the Morse index on minimal triple junction surfaces.

        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
          The classical Calder\'{o}n problem asks whether the conductivity of a medium can be deduced from boundary measurements given by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map. For anisotropic conductivities in dimensions $n\geq 3$, this problem can be framed geometrically as one concerning the recovery of a Riemannian metric from the DN map for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. In this talk, we discuss recent formulations of this problem for fractional operators and present a new result concerning the recovery of geometric structures from local measurements associated with a fractional connection Laplacian. Key to this proof is the use of the heat kernel and a transmutation formula to exploit properties of a related inverse problem for wave equations.

        </span>
        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
          Lowerscalar curvature bounds on spin Riemannian manifolds exhibit remarkableextremality and rigidity phenomena determined by spectral properties of Diracoperators. For example, a fundamental result of Llarull states that there is nosmooth Riemannian metric on the n-sphere which dominates the round metric andwhose scalar curvature is greater than or equal to the scalar curvature of theround metric, except for the round metric itself. A similar result holds forsmooth comparison maps from spin Riemannian manifolds to round spheres. 
          In ajoint work with Simone Cecchini and Thomas Schick, we generalize this result toRiemannian metrics with regularity less than C^1 and Lipschitz comparison maps,answering a question posed by Gromov in his "n
          
          
       Lectures". To thisend, we rely on a notion of scalar curvature in the distributional senseintroduced by Lee-LeFloch and on spectral properties of Lipschitz Diracoperators. It turns out that the existence of a nonzero harmonic spinor field -guaranteed by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem - forces the given comparison mapto be quasiregular in the sense of Reshetnyak. Thus we build an unexpectedbridge from spin geometry to the theory of quasiconformal mappings.

          This talk begins with a short introduction to General Relativity, and the black hole stability problem for the Kerr family of rotating black holes. One of the fundamental equations governing linear gravitational perturbations of this family is known as the Teukolsky master equation. We show that solutions arising from suitably regular initial data remain bounded and decay inverse polynomially in time. Our proof holds for the entire subextremal range of Kerr black hole parameters. This is joint work with Yakov Shlapentokh-Rothman (Toronto).

          Schoen-Yau proved the spacetime positive energy theorem by reducing it to the time-symmetric (Riemannian) case using the Jang equation. To acquire solutions to the Jang equation, they introduced a family of regularized equations and took the limit of regularized solutions, whereas a sequence of regularized solutions could blow up in some bounded regions enclosed by apparent horizons. They analyzed the blowup behavior near and outside the apparent horizons, but what happens inside remains unknown. In this talk, we will discuss the blowup behavior inside apparent horizons through two common geometric treatments: dilation and translation. We will also talk about the relation between the limits of blowup regularized solutions and constant expansion surfaces.

          In this talk, we will introduce the special Lagrangian and Lagrangian mean curvature type equations. We will derive a priori interior estimates for the Lagrangian mean curvature equation under certain natural restrictions on the Lagrangian angle. As an application, we will use these estimates to solve the Dirichlet problem for the Lagrangian mean curvature equation with continuous boundary data on a uniformly convex, bounded domain. We will also briefly introduce the fourth-order Hamiltonian stationary equation and mention some recent results on the regularity of solutions of certain fourth-order PDEs, which are critical points of variational integrals of the Hessian of a scalar function. Examples include volume functionals on Lagrangian submanifolds. This is based on joint works with C. Mooney and R. Shankar.

          framework to tackle the conjecture, and the main bulk of the talk is on the analytical aspects. It turns out
          that a very weak minimizer exists under a suitable Thomas-Yau semistability condition, and the main open problem
          is to prove the Euler Lagrange equation, which is the special Lagrangian condition.

          <!--Abstract-->
          I will focus on two closely related questions first considered by Gromov in Metric Structures: given a closed
          manifold M, (1) What is the maximal degree of an L-Lipschitz map M -> M? (2) Can M be efficiently wrapped with
          "Euclidean wrapping paper"? For example, let M_k be the connected sum of k copies of CP^2. If k ≤ 3, then M_k
          can be wrapped efficiently, and the maximal degree of an L-Lipschitz map is ~L^4. If k ≥ 4, then M_k cannot be
          wrapped with maximal efficiency, and the maximal degree is something like $L^4 \log(L)^{-\Theta(1)}$; to attain
          this bound, a map must have components at many different "frequencies" in a sense that I will explain. In
          general, which class a manifold belongs to depends on its cohomology ring. This is joint work with Sasha
          Berdnikov and Larry Guth.

          Riemannian metrics so that all area-minimizing integral (or mod 2, respectively) currents in [Σ] are singular

          The classical isoperimetric inequality says that a Euclidean ball is the minimal-perimeter way to enclose a
          given volume in R^n. If we want to enclose multiple volumes, it's natural to believe that the minimal-perimeter
          way looks like a cluster of soap bubbles, with interfaces made up of pieces of spheres meeting in certain
          prescribed ways. In the 1990s, Sullivan put forward a precise conjecture about the minimal-perimeter way to
          enclose n + 1 or fewer volumes in R^n. A seminar work of Hutchings, Morgan, Ritore, and Ros in 2000 solved this
          conjecture for two volumes in R^3; this was later extended to higher dimensions but remained mostly stuck at two
          volumes.
  
          I will discuss a recent work (joint with E. Milman) which makes substantial progress for n or fewer volumes in
          R^n. In particular, we completely settle the cases of three volumes in R^3 and above, and four volumes in R^4

          Constant mean curvature surfaces are critical points for the area functional under volume preserving variations.
          From this variational point of view, it is natural to study the index and its relations to the geometry and
          topology of these surfaces. In this talk, I will describe some classical and new results in this theme, as well
          as some open problems.
