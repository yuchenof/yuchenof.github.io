        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
          In this talk, we will consider minimal triple junction surfaces, a special class of singular minimal surfaces whose boundaries are identified in a particular manner. Hence, it is quite natural to extend the classical theory of minimal surfaces to minimal triple junction surfaces. Indeed, we can show that the classical PDE theory holds on triple junction surfaces. As a consequence, we can prove a type of Generalized Bernstein Theorem and talk about the Morse index on minimal triple junction surfaces.

        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
          The classical Calder\'{o}n problem asks whether the conductivity of a medium can be deduced from boundary measurements given by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map. For anisotropic conductivities in dimensions $n\geq 3$, this problem can be framed geometrically as one concerning the recovery of a Riemannian metric from the DN map for the Laplace-Beltrami operator. In this talk, we discuss recent formulations of this problem for fractional operators and present a new result concerning the recovery of geometric structures from local measurements associated with a fractional connection Laplacian. Key to this proof is the use of the heat kernel and a transmutation formula to exploit properties of a related inverse problem for wave equations.

        </span>
        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
          Lowerscalar curvature bounds on spin Riemannian manifolds exhibit remarkableextremality and rigidity phenomena determined by spectral properties of Diracoperators. For example, a fundamental result of Llarull states that there is nosmooth Riemannian metric on the n-sphere which dominates the round metric andwhose scalar curvature is greater than or equal to the scalar curvature of theround metric, except for the round metric itself. A similar result holds forsmooth comparison maps from spin Riemannian manifolds to round spheres. 
          In ajoint work with Simone Cecchini and Thomas Schick, we generalize this result toRiemannian metrics with regularity less than C^1 and Lipschitz comparison maps,answering a question posed by Gromov in his "Four Lectures". To thisend, we rely on a notion of scalar curvature in the distributional senseintroduced by Lee-LeFloch and on spectral properties of Lipschitz Diracoperators. It turns out that the existence of a nonzero harmonic spinor field -guaranteed by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem - forces the given comparison mapto be quasiregular in the sense of Reshetnyak. Thus we build an unexpectedbridge from spin geometry to the theory of quasiconformal mappings.

          This talk begins with a short introduction to General Relativity, and the black hole stability problem for the Kerr family of rotating black holes. One of the fundamental equations governing linear gravitational perturbations of this family is known as the Teukolsky master equation. We show that solutions arising from suitably regular initial data remain bounded and decay inverse polynomially in time. Our proof holds for the entire subextremal range of Kerr black hole parameters. This is joint work with Yakov Shlapentokh-Rothman (Toronto).

          <!--Abstract-->
          Schoen-Yau proved the spacetime positive energy theorem by reducing it to the time-symmetric (Riemannian) case using the Jang equation. To acquire solutions to the Jang equation, they introduced a family of regularized equations and took the limit of regularized solutions, whereas a sequence of regularized solutions could blow up in some bounded regions enclosed by apparent horizons. They analyzed the blowup behavior near and outside the apparent horizons, but what happens inside remains unknown. In this talk, we will discuss the blowup behavior inside apparent horizons through two common geometric treatments: dilation and translation. We will also talk about the relation between the limits of blowup regularized solutions and constant expansion surfaces.

          In this talk, we will introduce the special Lagrangian and Lagrangian mean curvature type equations. We will derive a priori interior estimates for the Lagrangian mean curvature equation under certain natural restrictions on the Lagrangian angle. As an application, we will use these estimates to solve the Dirichlet problem for the Lagrangian mean curvature equation with continuous boundary data on a uniformly convex, bounded domain. We will also briefly introduce the fourth-order Hamiltonian stationary equation and mention some recent results on the regularity of solutions of certain fourth-order PDEs, which are critical points of variational integrals of the Hessian of a scalar function. Examples include volume functionals on Lagrangian submanifolds. This is based on joint works with C. Mooney and R. Shankar.

          framework to tackle the conjecture, and the main bulk of the talk is on the analytical aspects. It turns out
          that a very weak minimizer exists under a suitable Thomas-Yau semistability condition, and the main open problem
          is to prove the Euler Lagrange equation, which is the special Lagrangian condition.

          <!--Abstract-->
          I will focus on two closely related questions first considered by Gromov in Metric Structures: given a closed
          manifold M, (1) What is the maximal degree of an L-Lipschitz map M -> M? (2) Can M be efficiently wrapped with
          "Euclidean wrapping paper"? For example, let M_k be the connected sum of k copies of CP^2. If k ≤ 3, then M_k
          can be wrapped efficiently, and the maximal degree of an L-Lipschitz map is ~L^4. If k ≥ 4, then M_k cannot be
          wrapped with maximal efficiency, and the maximal degree is something like $L^4 \log(L)^{-\Theta(1)}$; to attain
          this bound, a map must have components at many different "frequencies" in a sense that I will explain. In
          general, which class a manifold belongs to depends on its cohomology ring. This is joint work with Sasha
          Berdnikov and Larry Guth.

          Let dimensions d≥3, and codimensions c≥3 be positive integers. Set the exceptional set E={3,4}. For d∉E,c

          Riemannian metrics so that all area-minimizing integral (or mod 2, respectively) currents in [Σ] are singular
          for metrics in Ω_{[Σ]}. This settles a conjecture of White about the generic regularity of area-minimizing

          <!--Abstract-->
          The classical isoperimetric inequality says that a Euclidean ball is the minimal-perimeter way to enclose a
          given volume in R^n. If we want to enclose multiple volumes, it's natural to believe that the minimal-perimeter
          way looks like a cluster of soap bubbles, with interfaces made up of pieces of spheres meeting in certain
          prescribed ways. In the 1990s, Sullivan put forward a precise conjecture about the minimal-perimeter way to
          enclose n + 1 or fewer volumes in R^n. A seminar work of Hutchings, Morgan, Ritore, and Ros in 2000 solved this
          conjecture for two volumes in R^3; this was later extended to higher dimensions but remained mostly stuck at two
          volumes.
  
          I will discuss a recent work (joint with E. Milman) which makes substantial progress for n or fewer volumes in
          R^n. In particular, we completely settle the cases of three volumes in R^3 and above, and four volumes in R^4
          and above.

          From this variational point of view, it is natural to study the index and its relations to the geometry and
          topology of these surfaces. In this talk, I will describe some classical and new results in this theme, as well
          as some open problems.

          <!--Abstract-->
          An interesting feature of General Relativity is the presence of singularities which can happen in even the
          simplest examples such as the Schwarzschild spacetime. However, in this case the singularity is cloaked behind
          the event horizon of the black hole which has been conjectured to be generically the case. To analyze this
          so-called Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Penrose proposed in 1973 a test which involves Hawking's area theorem,
          the final state conjecture and a geometric inequality on initial data sets (M,g,k). For k=0 this Penrose
          inequality has been proven by Huisken-Ilmanen and by Bray using different methods, but in general the question
          is wide open. Huisken-Ilmanen's proof relies on the Hawking mass monotonicity formula under inverse mean
          curvature flow (IMCF), and the purpose of this talk is to generalize the Hawking mass monotonicity formula to
          initial data sets. For this purpose, we start with recalling spacetime harmonic functions and their applications
          which have been introduced together with Demetre Kazaras and Marcus Khuri in the context of the spacetime
          positive mass theorem.

A key ingredient of our approach is a new index theory for manifolds with polyhedral boundary.

      <b>Generic Regularity for All Minimal Hypersurfaces in 8-Manifolds:
      </b>
    </a>
    The well-known Simons cone suggests that singularities may exist in a stable minimal hypersurface in Riemannian
    manifolds of dimension greater than 7, locally modeled on stable minimal hypercones. It was conjectured that
    generically they can be perturbed away. In this talk, we present a way to eliminate these singularities by
    perturbing metric in an 8-manifold. By combining with a Sard-Type Theorem for space of singular minimal
    hypersurfaces of dimension $7$, we prove that in an 8-manifold with generic metric, every locally stable minimal
    hypersurface has no singularity. In particular, this proves the existence of infinitely many SMOOTH minimal
    hypersurfaces in a generic 8-manifold. This is based on the joint work with Yangyang Li.

      <b>Deformations of the Scalar Curvature and the Mean Curvature:
      </b>
    </a>
    In Riemannian manifold (M^n, g), it is well-known that its minimizing hypersurface is smooth when n<=7, and singular
      when n>=8. This is one of the major difficulties in generalizing many interesting results to higher dimensions,
      including the Riemannian Penrose inequality. In particular, in dimension 8, the minimizing hypersurface has
      isolated singularities, and Nathan Smale constructed a local perturbation process to smooth out the singularities.
      However, Smale's perturbation will also produce a small region with possibly negative scalar curvature. In order
      to apply this perturbation in general relativity, we constructed a local deformation prescribing the scalar
      curvature and the mean curvature simultaneously. In this talk, we will discuss how the weighted function spaces
      help us localize the deformation in complete manifolds with boundary, assuming certain generic conditions. We will
      also discuss some applications of this result in general relativity.

      with uniformly bounded index and area, and discrete singular set, then up to a subsequence all the $M_i$ are
      bi-Lipschitz equivalent, with uniform Lipschitz bounds on the maps. As a consequence, we prove the space of $C^2$

      A Riemannian metric on a closed manifold is called Zoll when all of its geodesics are closed and have the same
      period. Non-trivial rotationally symmetric Zoll metrics on the two-sphere were constructed by Otto Zoll in the
      beginning of the 1900's, but many questions about these metrics are still open. It seems that higher-dimensional

      very interesting objects to be investigated in relation to isodiastolic inequalities and other geometric problems,
      but also on their own account. In this talk, I will discuss some recent results about the construction and
      geometric understanding of these new Zoll-like geometries. This is a joint project with F. Marques (Princeton) and

          A quantification of Gromov's nonsqueezing theorem in dimension 4:
        </b>
      </a>
      The nonsqueezing theorem states that a ball B_R of radius larger than 1 in R^4 (with the standard symplectic
      structure) cannot be symplectically embedded inside the cylinder D x R^2 where D is the unit 2-disk. I will
      explain that this result can be quantified as follows: if E is a closed set and the complement of E in B_R
      symplectically embeds inside D x R^2, then the Minkowski dimension of E is at least 2, and this is optimal in
      general. The proof uses Gromov's waist inequality. This is joint work with Kevin Sackel, Umut Varolgunes and
      Jonathan Zhu.

      "Which manifolds admit a complete metric of positive scalar curvature R>0?" has gathered great interest over the

      seems to be more subtle. A related question (emphasized by Gromov among others) is "What is the geometry of spaces

      Mean curvature flow (MCF) is the gradient flow of the area functional; it moves the surface in the direction of
      steepest decrease of area. An important motivation for the study of MCF comes from its potential geometric
      applications, such as classification theorems and geometric inequalities. MCF develops "singularities" (curvature
      blow-up), which obstruct the flow from existing for all times and therefore understanding these high curvature
      regions is of great interest. This is done by studying ancient solutions, solutions that have existed for all
      times in the past, and which model singularities. In this talk we will present recent developments concerning
      ancient solutions. Among other things we will discuss a new way of constructing and classifying collapsed
      solutions. This is joint work with Mat Langford, Stephen Lynch and Giuseppe Tinaglia.

      </a>The existence of a closed minimal hypersurface in a compact Riemannian manifold was first established by the
      combined efforts of Almgren, Pitts, Schoen-Simon-Yau, Schoen-Simon in the early 80s by means of what is nowadays
      called minmax a la Almgren-Pitts. An alternative approach to reach the same existence result has been implemented
      in recent years in a work by Guaraco, using a minmax construction for the Allen-Cahn energy, in combination with
      works by Hutchinson-Tonegawa, Tonegawa, Tonegawa-Wickramasekera, Wickramasekera. A natural question (ubiquitous in
      geometric analysis and, in particular, in minmax constructions) is whether the minimal hypersurface is obtained
      with multiplicity 1. The multiplicity-1 information has important geometric consequences. However, the a priori
      possibility of higher multiplicity is intrinsic in both minmax constructions, as they are carried out in the class
      of varifolds. After an overview, this talk focuses on the case of an ambient Riemannian manifold (of dimension 3
      or higher) with positive Ricci curvature: in this case, the minmax construction via Allen-Cahn yields a
      multiplicity-1 minimal hypersurface. If time permits, the case of low-dimensional manifolds endowed with a bumpy
      metric will also be addressed.

      Instead, we introduce the notion of the $d_p$ distance between (in particular) Riemannian manifolds, which
      measures the distance between $W^{1,p}$ Sobolev spaces, and it is with respect to this distance that the
      $\epsilon$ regularity theorem holds. We will discuss various applications to manifolds with scalar curvature and
      entropy lower bounds, including a compactness and limit structure theorem for sequences and a priori $L^p$ scalar
      curvature bounds for $p < 1$. This is joint work with Man-Chun Lee and Aaron Naber. </p>

          </b>
        </a>
        Minimal hypersurfaces in 8-dimensional Riemannian manifolds may have isolated singularities. However, it follows
        from results of R. Hardt, L. Simon and N. Smale that one can perturb away singularities of an area minimizing
        minimal hypersurface by a small change of the metric. I will talk about a similar problem for min-max minimal
        hypersurfaces (joint work with Otis Chodosh and Luca Spolaor). We show that for a generic 8-dimensional
        Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature, there exists a smooth minimal hypersurface. Without the
        curvature condition, we show that for a dense set of 8-dimensional Riemannian metrics there exists a minimal
        hypersurface with at most one singular point. Our proof uses a construction of optimal nested sweepouts from a
        joint work with Gregory Chambers.

        This talk gives an overview of two recent joint works. The first work, joint with Kyeongsu Choi, studies closed
        ancient solutions to gradient flows of elliptic functionals in Riemannian manifolds. Our methods classify
        ancient solutions coming out of a critical point, with very mild decay assumptions, establishing that they are
        parametrized by unstable eigenfunctions of the critical point. Applied to mean curvature flow, these methods
        imply an arbitrary dimension and codimension classification of ancient mean curvature flows of closed
        submanifolds of S^n with low area. The second work, joint with Otis Chodosh, Kyeongsu Choi, and Felix Schulze,
        extends these methods to study ancient mean curvature flows lying on one side of asymptotically conical
        shrinking solitons. As an application, we partially confirm the conjectured non-linear instability of
        asymptotically conical singularity models in mean curvature flow.

        Given a compact Riemannian manifold M, the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map acting on the boundary of

        each perimeter-normalized Steklov eigenvalue of planar domains: the best upper bound for the $k+1$-th
        perimeter-normalized Steklov eigenvalue is $8k\pi$. The proofs are based on continuity properties for
        variational eigenvalues associated to Radon measures on compact manifolds. In particular, starting with any
        domain in the plane, we constructed a sequence of subdomains with its $k+1$-th perimeter-normalized Steklov
        eigenvalue converging to $8k\pi$. These subdomains are obtained by removing small disks from the initial domain,
        in the spirit of homogenization theory. Properties of maximizing sequences will also be discussed, showing in
        particular that any sequence of domains with prescribed perimeter with its first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue
        converging to $8\pi$ must collapse to a point. This talk is based on recent papers with with Antoine Henrot (U.

        Given a compact initial data set with boundary, the Bartnik problem is the problem of finding asymptotically
        flat initial data that extends given data in such a way that it minimizes mass among all possible (admissible)
        extensions satisfying the dominant energy condition. Bartnik conjectured that if such a minimizer exists, then
        it must be stationary in the extended region. In the time-symmetric case, this was settled by Corvino (in which
        case the stationary extension is actually static). In joint work with Lan-Hsuan Huang of the University of
        Connecticut, we are able to prove in the general case that a minimizing extension must be vacuum stationary
        outside some large compact set. Our proof involves finding ways to locally deform the geometry of an initial
        data set in such a way that we have useful control over the energy-momentum density.

            Solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation on closed manifolds in the presence of symmetry:

        In recent years, there has been remarkable development about the connection between the Allen-Cahn equation and
        minimal hypersurfaces. A result due to F. Pacard and M. RitorÃ shows that given a minimal hypersurface Î in a
        closed manifold M, we can find solutions of this PDE whose nodal sets approximate Î, provided it is a
        nondegenerate critical point of the area functional. This condition is often too restrictive, as many
        interesting examples of ambient manifolds have continuous groups of symmetries, and the corresponding variations
        preserve the area of any hypersurface. In this talk, we explain how to obtain a similar existence result in the
        case where all Jacobi fields of Î arise from ambient isometries. We also derive some geometric consequences,
        and describe a second order convergence result for multiplicity-one solutions, in terms of the corresponding

            Generalizing the Linearized Doubling Approach and New Minimal Surfaces and Self-Shrinkers via Doubling:
          </b>
        </a>
        I will discuss recent work (with N. Kapouleas) on generalizing the Linearized Doubling approach to apply (under
        reasonable assumptions) to doubling arbitrary closed minimal surfaces in arbitrary Riemannian three-manifolds
        without any symmetry requirements. More precisely, given a family of LD solutions on a closed minimal surfaces
        embedded in a Riemannian three-manifold, where an LD solution is a solution of the Jacobi equation with
        logarithmic singularities, we prove a general theorem which states that if the family satisfies certain
        conditions, then a new minimal surface can be constructed via doubling, with catenoidal bridges replacing the
        singularities of one of the LD solutions. The construction of the required LD solutions is currently only
        understood when the surface and ambient manifold possess O(2) symmetry and the number of bridges is chosen large
        enough along O(2) orbits. In this spirit, we use the theorem to construct new self-shrinkers of the mean
        curvature flow via doubling the spherical self-shrinker and new complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite
        total curvature in the Euclidean three-space via doubling the catenoid.

        We present the recent tools we developed to prove existence and regularity properties of the critical points of
        anisotropic functionals. In particular, we present our extension of Allard's celebrated rectifiability theorem
        to the setting of varifolds with bounded anisotropic first variation. We apply this result to solve the
        set-theoretic anisotropic Plateau problem. We obtain as corollaries easy solutions to three different
        formulations of the Plateau problem, introduced by Reifenberg, by Harrison-Pugh and by David. Moreover, we prove
        an anisotropic counterpart of Allard's compactness theorem for integral varifolds. To conclude, we focus on the
        anisotropic isoperimetric problem. We prove the anisotropic counterpart of Alexandrov's characterization of
        volume-constrained critical points among finite perimeter sets. Furthermore we derive stability inequalities
        associated to this rigidity theorem. Some of the presented theorems are joint works with De Lellis, De
        Philippis, Ghiraldin, Gioffre, Kolasinski and Santilli.

            Bubble tree convergence of conformally cross product preserving maps:

        We study a class of weakly conformal maps, called Smith maps, which parametrize associative 3-folds in
        7-manifolds equipped with G2-structures. These maps satisfy a system of first-order PDEs generalizing the
        Cauchy-Riemann equation for J-holomorphic curves, and we are interested in their bubbling phenomena.
        Specifically, we first prove an epsilon-regularity theorem for Smith maps in W^{1, 3}, and then explain how that
        combines with conformal invariance to yield bubble trees of Smith maps from sequences of such maps with
        uniformly bounded 3-energy. When the G2-structure is closed, we show that both the 3-energy and the homotopy are
        preserved in the bubble tree limit. The result can be viewed as an associative analogue of the bubble tree
        convergence theorem for J-holomorphic curves. This is joint work with Spiro Karigiannis and Jesse Madnick.

        Mirror symmetry originally arose as a mysterious duality between Calabi-Yau threefolds, interchanging complex

        including Fano manifolds, and Landau-Ginzburg models. Two fundamental themes in mirror symmetry are (1) the

        between "stable" objects as predicted in work of Thomas-Yau, and Douglas. Here, stable objects are meant to be
        special Lagrangian manifolds on the symplectic side, and holomorphic bundles with canonical metrics, on the
        complex side. I will report on recent results in both of these directions. This talk with discuss joint works

        I will present a series of results concerning the interplay between two different curvature conditions, in the
        special case when these are given by pointwise inequalities on the scalar curvature of a manifold, and the mean
        curvature of its boundary. Such results lie at two conceptual levels: on the one hand at the level of
        compatibility (i.e. is it possible to simultaneously satisfy the bounds, and what are the resulting topological
        implications), on the other hand at the level of moduli space structure (i.e. what can one say about the
        homotopy type of the associated space of metrics, when not empty, quotiented by the diffeomorphism group of the
        background manifold). In particular, we give a complete topological characterization of those compact
        3-manifolds that support Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature and mean-convex boundary and, in any
        such case, we prove that the associated moduli space of metrics is path-connected. Furthermore, we show how our
        methods can be refined so to construct continuous paths of positive scalar curvature metrics with minimal
        boundary, and to obtain analogous conclusions in that context as well. Our work relies on a combination of
        earlier fundamental contributions by Gromov-Lawson and Schoen-Yau, on the smoothing procedure designed by Miao,
        and on the interplay of Perelman's Ricci flow with surgery and conformal deformation techniques introduced by
        CodÃ¡ Marques in dealing with the closed case. This lecture is based on joint work with Chao Li (Princeton

        A celebrated theorem of F. HÃ©lein guarantees that a weakly harmonic map from a two-dimensional domain is always
        smooth. The proof is of a local nature and assumes that the Dirichlet energy is sufficiently small; under this
        condition it is possible to re-write the harmonic map equation using a suitably chosen frame which uncovers
        non-linearities with more favourable regularity properties (so-called div-curl or Wente structures). We will
        prove a global estimate for harmonic maps without assuming a small energy bound, utilising a powerful theory
        introduced by T. RiviÃ¨re. Along the way we will highlight the relevance of Wente-type estimates in neighbouring
        areas of geometric analysis, and hint as to why the analogous higher-dimensional global estimate remains a
        challenging open problem. This is a joint work with Tobias Lamm.

            The Cost of the Sphere Eversion and the 16\pi Conjecture:
          </b>
        </a>
        How much does it cost...to knot a closed simple curve ? To cover the sphere twice ? to realize such or such
        homotopy class ? ...etc. All these questions consisting of assigning a "canonical" number and possibly an
        optimal "shape" to a given topological operation are known to be mathematically very rich and to bring together
        notions and techniques from topology, geometry and analysis. In this talk we will concentrate on the operation
        consisting of turning inside out the 2 sphere in the 3 dimensional space. Since Smale's proof in 1959 of the
        existence of such an operation the search for effective realizations of such eversions has triggered a lot of
        fascination and works in the math community. The absence in nature of matter that can interpenetrate and the
        quasi impossibility, up to the advent of virtual imaging, to experience this deformation is maybe the reason for
        the difficulty to develop an intuitive approach on the problem. We will present the optimization of Sophie
        Germain conformally invariant elastic energy for the eversion. Our efforts will finally bring us to consider
        more closely an integer number together with a mysterious minimal surface.

        We prove a conformally invariant estimate for the index of Schrodinger operators acting on vector bundles over

        growth rate. Furthermore we derive an index estimate for Einstein metrics in terms of the topology and the
        Einstein-Hilbert energy. Lastly we derive conformally invariant estimates for the Betti numbers of an oriented
        four-manifold with positive scalar curvature.

        of Yamabe-type equations. There has been considerable interest in recent years in proving compactness results

        geometry and asymptotic analysis. We prove a sharp result on the removability of the isolated singularity for
        all components of the solutions when the dimension is less than or equal to five and minus the potential of the
        operator in the system is cooperative.

            Stable constant-mean-curvature hypersurfaces: regularity and compactness:
          </b>
        </a>
        This talk describes a recent joint work of the speaker with N. Wickramasekera (Cambridge). The work develops a
        regularity theory, with an associated compactness theorem, for weakly defined hypersurfaces (codimension 1
        integral varifolds) of a smooth Riemannian manifold that are stationary and stable on their regular parts for
        volume preserving ambient deformations. The main regularity theorem gives two structural conditions on such a
        hypersurface that imply that, away from a set of codimension 7 or higher, the hypersurface is locally either a
        single smoothly embedded disk or precisely two smoothly embedded disks intersecting tangentially. Easy examples
        show that neither structural hypothesis can be relaxed. An important special case is when the varifold
        corresponds to the boundary of a Caccioppoli set, in which case the structural conditions can be considerably
        weakened. An "effective version" of the compactness theorem has been (a posteriori) established in collaboration
        with O. Chodosh and N. Wickramasekera.

        but counterexamples exist when $k>1$. We will also describe the how the energy can be viewed as a regularization
        of the BV energy.

        on a manifold of dimension between 3 and 7 and positive Ricci curvature. Combined with the works of
        Marques-Neves we can also obtain some information on the geometry of the minimal hypersurfaces they found.

            The Cheeger constant of a Jordan domain without necks:</b>
        </a>
        In 1970, Cheeger established lower bounds on the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on compact Riemannian
        manifolds in terms of a certain isoperimetric problem. The analogous problem on domains of Euclidean space has
        generated much interest in recent years, due in part to its connections to capillarity theory, image processing,
        and landslide modeling. In this talk, based on joint work with Leonardi and Saracco, we give an explicit
        characterization of minimizers in this isoperimetric problem for a very general class of planar domains.

            Denseness of closed geodesics on surfaces with generic Riemannian metrics:

        </a>
        We prove that, on a closed surface with a $C^\infty$-generic Riemannian metric, the union of nonconstant closed
        geodesics is dense. This result follows from a more general result about periodic orbits of Reeb dynamics on
        contact three-manifolds. The proof uses embedded contact homology (ECH), a version of Floer homology definedfor
        contact three-manifolds, which was introduced by Hutchings. In particular, the key ingredient is the ``Weyl
        law'' for ECH spectral numbers, which was proved by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings, and Ramos. We also discuss a
        denseness of minimal hypersurfaces for genericmetrics (joint work with Marques and Neves), which was obtained by
        applying a similar idea to the Weyl law for volume spectrum, which was proved by Liokumovich, Marques, and
        Neves.

            The bounded diameter conjecture for 2-convex mean curvature flow:</b>
        </a>
        In this talk I address the bounded diameter conjecture for the mean curvature flow of smooth 2-convex
        hypersurfaces in $R^{n+1}$. In joint work with Robert Haslhofer, we prove that the intrinsic diameter of the
        evolving hypersurfaces is controlled, up to the first singular time, in terms of geometric information of the
        initial hypersurface. Moreover, this diameter estimate leads to sharp $L^{nâ1}$ estimates for the curvature at
        each time. Our estimates extend to mean curvature flow with surgery, which allows us to obtain the optimal
        $L^{nâ1}$ estimate for any level set flow starting from a smooth 2-convex hypersurface. This improves the
        $L^{nâ1â\varepsilon}$ curvature estimate that was previously established in work of Head and
        Cheeger-Haslhofer-Naber.

        Let M be a closed oriented 3-manifold not diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere, and suppose that there is a strongly

        steps are non-trivially incomplete and we will explain how to justify them. The key point is a version of
        min-max theory producing interior minimal surfaces when the ambient manifold has minimal boundary. Some
        corollaries of the theorem include the existence in any RP^3 of either a minimal torus or a minimal projective
        plane with stable universal cover. Several consequences for metric with positive scalar curvature are also

        A large family of theorems all state that if a space is topologically complex, then the functions on that space
        must express that complexity, for instance by having many singularities. For the theorem in this talk, our
        preferred measure of topological complexity is the hyperbolic volume of a closed manifold admitting a hyperbolic
        metric (or more generally, the Gromov simplicial volume of any space). A Morse function on a manifold with large
        hyperbolic volume may still not have many critical points, but we show that there must be many flow lines
        connecting those few critical points. Specifically, given a closed n-dimensional manifold and a Morse-Smale
        function, the number of n-part broken trajectories is at least the Gromov simplicial volume. To prove this we
        adapt lemmas of Gromov that bound the simplicial volume of a stratified space in terms of the complexity of the
        stratification.

        </a>
        The Allen-Cahn construction is a method for constructing minimal surfaces of codimension 1 in closed manifolds.
        In this approach, minimal hypersurfaces arise as the weak limits of level sets of critical points of the
        Allen-Cahn energy functional. This talk will relate the variational properties of the Allen-Cahn energy to those
        of the area functional on the surface arising in the limit, under the assumption that the limit surface is
        two-sided. In this case, bounds for the Morse indices of the critical points lead to a bound for the Morse index
        of the limit minimal surface. As a corollary, minimal hypersurfaces arising from an Allen-Cahn p-parameter
        min-max construction have index at most p. An analogous argument also establishes a lower bound for the spectrum
        of the Jacobi operator of the limit surface.

        </a>
        Free boundary minimal surfaces are natural variational objects that have been studied since the 40s. In spite of
        this, very few explicit examples in the simplest case of the round three ball are known. I will describe how
        variational methods can be used to construct new examples with unbounded genus resembling a desingularization of
        the critical catenoid and flat disk. I will also give a new variational interpretation of the previously known
        examples.

        A conjecture of Marques-Neves-Schoen says that for every embedded minimal hypersurface M in a manifold of
        positive Ricci curvature, the first Betti number of M is bounded above linearly by the index of M. We will show
        that for every compact symmetric space this result holds, up to replacing the index of M with its extended

        the canonical one. These results are a joint work with R. Mendes.

            Uniqueness of mean curvature flow with mean convex singularities:
          </b>
        </a>
        Given a smooth compact hypersurface in Euclidean space, one can show that there exists a unique smooth evolution
        starting from it, existing for some maximal time. But what happens after the flow becomes singular? There are
        several notions through which one can describe weak evolutions past singularities, with various relationship
        between them. One such notion is that of the level set flow. While the level set flow is almost by definition
        unique, it has an undesirable phenomenon called fattening: Our "weak evolution" of n-dimensional hypersurfaces
        may develop (and does develop in some cases) an interior in R^{n+1}. This fattening is, in many ways, the right
        notion of non-uniqueness for weak mean curvature. As was alluded to above, fattening can not occur as long as
        the flow is smooth. Thus it is reasonable to say that the source of fattening is singularities. Permitting
        singularities, it is very easy to show that fattening does not occur if the initial hypersurface, and thus all
        the evolved hypersurface, are mean convex. Thus, singularities encountered during mean convex mean curvature
        flow should be of the kind that does not create singularities (i.e, the local structure of the singularities
        should prevent fattening, without any global mean convexity assumption). To put differently, it is reasonable to
        conjecture that: "An evolving surface cannot fatten unless it has a singularity with no spacetime neighborhood
        in which the surface is mean convex". In this talk, we will phrase a concrete formulation of this conjecture,
        and describe its proof. This is a joint work with Brian White.

        In this talk, we discuss a compactness result on the space of compact Lagrangian self-shrinkers in R^4. When the

        finitely many values; this is done by deriving a Lojasiewicz-Simon type gradient inequality for the branched
        conformal self-shrinking tori. Using the finiteness of entropy values, we construct a piecewise Lagrangian mean
        curvature flow for Lagrangian immersed tori in R^4, along which the Lagrangian condition is preserved, area is
        decreasing, and the type I singularities that are compact with a fixed area upper bound can be perturbed away in
        finite steps. This is a Lagrangian version of the construction for embedded surfaces in R^3 by Colding and
        Minicozzi. This is a joint work with Jingyi Chen.

            Zero Sets of Smooth Functions and p-Sweepouts:
          </b>
        </a>
        It is well known that any closed set can occur as the zero set of a smooth function. But in many contexts in
        analysis, one does not work with arbitrary smooth functions; one works with smooth functions that vanish to only
        finite order. And the zero set of any such function must have some regularity and structure. With recourse to an
        analogy made by Gromov and some recent conjectures of Marques and Neves, I will explain the application of some
        general results about such zero sets to p-sweepouts (which are p-dimensional families of generalized
        hypersurfaces that sweepout a smooth manifold in a certain sense). In the course of doing so, I will explain a
        new result about the regularity of zero sets of smooth functions near a point of finite vanishing order (joint
        work with Tom Beck and Boris Hanin).

            Entropy and self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow:
          </b>
        </a>
        The Colding-Minicozzi entropy is an important tool for understanding the mean curvature flow (MCF), and is a
        measure of the complexity of a submanifold. Together with Ilmanen and White, they conjectured that the round
        sphere minimises entropy amongst all closed hypersurfaces. We will review the basics of MCF and their theory of
        generic MCF, then describe the resolution of the above conjecture, due to J. Bernstein and L. Wang for
        dimensions up to six and recently claimed by the speaker for all remaining dimensions. A key ingredient in the
        latter is the classification of entropy-stable self-shrinkers that may have a small singular set.

            New doubling constructions for minimal surfaces:

        </a>
        I will discuss recent work (with Nikolaos Kapouleas) on constructions of new embedded minimal surfaces using
        singular perturbation 'gluing' methods. I will discuss at length doublings of the equatorial S^2 in S^3. In
        contrast to earlier work of Kapouleas, the catenoidal bridges may be placed on arbitrarily many parallel circles
        on the base S^2. This necessitates a more detailed understanding of the linearized problem and more exacting
        estimates on associated linearized doubling solutions.

        The renormalized volume V_R is a finite quantity associated to certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds of infinite
        volume. In this talk I'll discuss its definition and some properties for acylindrical manifolds, namely local
        convexity and convergence under geometric limits. If time suffices I'll also discuss some applications and
        further examples.

        There is a special relationship between the Jacobi and the ambient scalar curvature operator. I'll talk about an
        extremal bending technique that exploits this relationship. It lets us compute the Bartnik mass of apparent
        horizons and disprove a form of the Hoop conjecture due to G. Gibbons. Then, I'll talk about a derived
        "cut-and-fill" technique that simplifies 3-manifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature. It is used in studying a
        priori L^1 estimates for boundary mean curvature for compact initial data sets, and in generalizing Brown-York
        mass. Parts of this talk reflect work done jointly with R. Schoen/P. Miao.

            Index Characterization for Free Boundary Minimal Surfaces:
          </b>
        </a>
        A FBMS in the unit Euclidean ball is a critical point of the area functional among all surfaces with boundaries
        in the unit sphere, the boundary of the ball. The Morse index gives the number of distinct admissible
        deformations which decrease the area to second order. In this talk, we explain how to compute the index from
        data of two simpler problems. The first one is the corresponding problem with fixed boundary condition; and the
        second is associated with the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Jacobi fields. We also discuss applications to a
        conjecture about FBMS with index 4. </p>
